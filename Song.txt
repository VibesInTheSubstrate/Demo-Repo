Chorus

Somehow I missed you
Before I met you, so
I'm gonna love you
Before I let you go

We need to talk
So can you please take my call
You are the only one
Who can break my fall

Verse 1

it's always been a given
you resort to burning bridges
before you push your limits
just an inch
or just a smidgeon

I know you feel what's missing
it distorts and warps your senses
until you stop to listen
look again
it's a beginning

Chorus

Somehow I missed you
Before I met you, so
I'm gonna love you
Before I let you go

We need to talk
So can you please take my call
You are the only one
Who can break my fall

Cause it won't be enough forever
Twining fingers through a chain link fence
More to the point the truth is
We were never just friends
Til I can decipher your hieroglyphs
With something that approaches confidence
Give me something I can touch
Be somebody I can put my trust in
